# 226FaceRecog
Recognizes people in CKHS class 226 by their photos. This uses the Yolov3 model described here (https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/), and uses a PyTorch implementation here (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3). Stored here will be the weights trained, the results.txt files, utility files written by us to streamline the process of training, and the training/testing dataset.
